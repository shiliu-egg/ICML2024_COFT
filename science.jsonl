It is like the difference between saying \"There is no bucket\" and saying \"The bucket is empty\".\nA notable exception to the above may be the Grelling\u2013Nelson paradox, in which words and meaning are the elements of the scenario rather than people and hair-cutting. Though it is easy to refute the barber's paradox by saying that such a barber does not (and cannot) exist, it is impossible to say something similar about a meaningfully defined word.\nOne way that the paradox has been dramatised is as follows: Suppose that every public library has to compile a catalogue of all its books. Since the catalogue is itself one of the library's books, some librarians include it in the catalogue for completeness; while others leave it out as it being one of the library's books is self-evident. Now imagine that all these catalogues are sent to the national library. Some of them include themselves in their listings, others do not. The national librarian compiles two master catalogues\u2014one of all the catalogues that list themselves, and one of all those that don't.\nThe question is: should these master catalogues list themselves? The 'Catalogue of all catalogues that list themselves' is no problem. If the librarian doesn't include it in its own listing, it remains a true catalogue of those catalogues that do include themselves. If he does include it, it remains a true catalogue of those that list themselves. However, just as the librarian cannot go wrong with the first master catalogue, he is doomed to fail with the second. When it comes to the 'Catalogue of all catalogues that don't list themselves', the librarian cannot include it in its own listing, because then it would include itself, and so belong in the other catalogue, that of catalogues that do include themselves. However, if the librarian leaves it out, the catalogue is incomplete. Either way, it can never be a true master catalogue of catalogues that do not list themselves.\nAs illustrated above for the barber paradox, Russell's paradox is not hard to extend. Take:\nForm the sentence:\nSometimes the \"all\" is replaced by \"all \u27e8V\u27e9ers\".\nAn example would be \"paint\":\nor \"elect\"\nIn the Season 8 episode of The Big Bang Theory, \"The Skywalker Intrusion\", Sheldon Cooper analyzes the song \"Play That Funky Music\", concluding that the lyrics present a musical example of Russell's Paradox.[25]\nParadoxes that fall in this scheme include:\n"], "id": 6}

Next, we use reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the original language model with respect to the reward model.\n\nTraining a language model with reinforcement learning was, for a long time, something that people would have thought as impossible both for engineering and algorithmic reasons. What multiple organizations seem to have gotten to work is fine-tuning some or all of the parameters of a copy of the initial LM with a policy-gradient RL algorithm, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Parameters of the LM are frozen because fine-tuning an entire 10B or 100B+ parameter model is prohibitively expensive (for more, see Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for LMs or the Sparrow LM from DeepMind). PPO has been around for a relatively long time \u2013 there are tons of guides on how it works. The relative maturity of this method made it a favorable choice for scaling up to the new application of distributed training for RLHF. It turns out that many of the core RL advancements to do RLHF have been figuring out how to update such a large model with a familiar algorithm (more on that later).Let's first formulate this fine-tuning task as a RL problem. First, the policy is a language model that takes in a prompt and returns a sequence of text (or just probability distributions over text). The action space of this policy is all the tokens corresponding to the vocabulary of the language model (often on the order of 50k tokens) and the observation space is the distribution of possible input token sequences, which is also quite large given previous uses of RL (the dimension is approximately the size of vocabulary ^ length of the input token sequence). The reward function is a combination of the preference model and a constraint on policy shift.The reward function is where the system combines all of the models we have discussed into one RLHF process. Given a prompt, x,\u00a0 from the dataset, two texts, y1, y2, are generated \u2013 one from the initial language model and one from the current iteration of the fine-tuned policy. The text from the current policy is passed to the preference model, which returns a scalar notion of \u201cpreferability\u201d, r\u03b8 r_\\theta r\u03b8\u200b. This text is compared to the text from the initial model to compute a penalty on the difference between them. In multiple papers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and DeepMind, this penalty has been designed as a scaled version of the Kullback\u2013Leibler (KL) divergence between these sequences of distributions over tokens, rKL r_\\text{KL} rKL\u200b. The KL divergence term penalizes the RL policy from moving substantially away from the initial pretrained model with each training batch, which can be useful to make sure the model outputs reasonably coherent text snippets. Without this penalty the optimization can start to generate text that is gibberish but fools the reward model to give a high reward. In practice, the KL divergence is approximated via sampling from both distributions (explained by John Schulman here). The final reward sent to the RL update rule is r=r\u03b8\u2212\u03bbrKL r = r_\\theta - \\lambda r_\\text{KL} r=r\u03b8\u200b\u2212\u03bbrKL\u200b.Some"], "id": 11}

The typical fusion reaction creates the inert gas helium while also producing and consuming tritium within the plant. As a beta emitter, tritium is radioactive, but it has a short half-life and is only used in very small amounts, so does not pose a serious danger.Because it is impossible to recreate the type of pressure that allows fusion to occur naturally in the core of the Sun, fusion power plants instead require more heat.

However, fission power plants generate unstable nuclei, some of which are radioactive for thousands of years while fusion doesn\u2019t create any long-term nuclear waste. The typical fusion reaction creates the inert gas helium while also producing and consuming tritium within the plant. As a beta emitter, tritium is radioactive, but it has a short half-life and is only used in very small amounts, so does not pose a serious danger.Because it is impossible to recreate the type of pressure that allows fusion to occur naturally in the core of the Sun, fusion power plants instead require more heat. Producing the required levels of heat to allow fusion to take place (150-300 million \u00b0C) requires more energy than the fission process. Reducing the energy required for fusion is one of the biggest challenges faced by the nuclear industry.Both fusion and fission involve nuclear reactions that release large amounts of energy that can be used to produce electricity. However, fission is the splitting of atoms, while fusion joins them together.Fusion and fission are both nuclear processes that can be used to produce energy. Fission is where a large, unstable nucleus is split in two and fusion is where two smaller nuclei are joined to create a larger nucleus.Fission is much easier to achieve than fusion although fission produces long-term radioactive by-products that are not created with fusion.However, while fusion occurs naturally in the core of the Sun, it is difficult to create the required conditions on Earth, meaning that it has yet to be adopted for power generation, although it has been described as the \u2018holy grail of clean energy.\u2019For more information please email:contactus@twi.co.ukBrowser does not support script.Browser does not support script.Browser does not support script.Browser does not support script.Browser does not support script."], "id": 20}

Graham measured the rate of diffusion of gases through plaster plugs, through very fine tubes, and through small orifices. In this way he slowed down the process so that it could be studied quantitatively. He first stated in 1831 that the rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its density, and later in 1848 showed that this rate is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass.[1] Graham went on to study the diffusion of substances in solution and in the process made the discovery that some apparent solutions actually are suspensions of particles too large to pass through a parchment filter. He termed these materials colloids, a term that has come to denote an important class of finely divided materials.[3]\nAround the time Graham did his work, the concept of molecular weight was being established largely through the measurements of gases. Daniel Bernoulli suggested in 1738 in his book Hydrodynamica that heat increases in proportion to the velocity, and thus kinetic energy, of gas particles. Italian physicist Amedeo Avogadro also suggested in 1811 that equal volumes of different gases contain equal numbers of molecules. Thus, the relative molecular weights of two gases are equal to the ratio of weights of equal volumes of the gases. Avogadro's insight together with other studies of gas behaviour provided a basis for later theoretical work by Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell to explain the properties of gases as collections of small particles moving through largely empty space.[4]\nPerhaps the greatest success of the kinetic theory of gases, as it came to be called, was the discovery that for gases, the temperature as measured on the Kelvin (absolute) temperature scale is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the gas molecules. Graham's law for diffusion could thus be understood as a consequence of the molecular kinetic energies being equal at the same temperature.[5]\nThe rationale of the above can be summed up as follows:\nKinetic energy of each type of particle (in this example, Hydrogen and Oxygen, as above) within the system is equal, as defined by thermodynamic temperature:\nWhich can be simplified and rearranged to:\nor:\nErgo, when constraining the system to the passage of particles through an area, Graham's Law appears as written at the start of this article.\n"], "id": 32}

The energy change associated with this transition provides information on the structure of the molecule and determines many of its properties, such as colour. The relationship between the energy involved in the electronic transition and the frequency of radiation is given by Planck's relation.\nThe electronic transitions in organic compounds and some other compounds can be determined by ultraviolet\u2013visible spectroscopy, provided that transitions in the ultraviolet (UV) or visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum exist for the compound.[1][2] Electrons occupying a HOMO (highest-occupied molecular orbital) of a sigma bond (\u03c3) can get excited to the LUMO (lowest-occupied molecular orbital) of that bond. This process is denoted as a \u03c3 \u2192 \u03c3* transition. Likewise, promotion of an electron from a pi-bonding orbital (\u03c0) to an antibonding pi orbital (\u03c0*) is denoted as a \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* transition. Auxochromes with free electron pairs (denoted as \"n\") have their own transitions, as do aromatic pi bond transitions.  Sections of molecules which can undergo such detectable electron transitions can be referred to as chromophores, since such transitions absorb electromagnetic radiation (light), which may be hypothetically perceived as color somewhere in the electromagnetic spectrum.  The following molecular electronic transitions exist:\nIn addition to these assignments, electronic transitions also have so-called bands associated with them. The following bands are defined (by A. Burawoy in 1930):[3]\nFor example, the absorption spectrum for ethane shows a \u03c3 \u2192 \u03c3* transition at 135\u00a0nm and that of water a n \u2192 \u03c3* transition at 167\u00a0nm with an extinction coefficient of 7,000. Benzene has three aromatic \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* transitions; two E-bands at 180 and 200\u00a0nm and one B-band at 255\u00a0nm with extinction coefficients respectively 60,000, 8,000 and 215. These absorptions are not narrow bands but are generally broad because the electronic transitions are superimposed on the other molecular energy states.\nThe electronic transitions of molecules in solution can depend strongly on the type of solvent with additional bathochromic shifts or hypsochromic shifts.\nSpectral lines are associated with atomic electronic transitions and polyatomic gases have their own absorption band system.[4]\n"], "id": 33}

However, after the 1920s, it was discovered that the Milky Way is just one among the several galaxies that exist in our universe. The galaxy is estimated to have a diameter of between 150,000 and 200,000 light years. The solar system is estimated to lie at a radius of about 26,490 light years from the galactic center in the Milky Way. Some of the common elements in the Milky Way galaxy include hydrogen, helium, oxygen, carbon, and others. Hydrogen is by far the universe\u2019s most abundant element. It accounts for about 75% of the baryonic mass in the universe. Most of the non-remnant stars are primarily made up of hydrogen, particularly in a plasma state. Diatomic hydrogen appeared in the universe during the recombination or Big Bang epoch. Hydrogen in its standard pressure and temperature is odorless, colorless, tasteless, non-metallic, non-toxic, and highly combustible. Hydrogen found in the universe is not in the form of the chemical-element type, but it is believed to occur in undetected forms such as dark energy and dark matter. Hydrogen is the most abundant in the Milky Way galaxy and our solar system. Most stars have hydrogen in abundance, and it is the element that powers the stars through the CNO and Proton-to-proton reaction of nuclear fusion. Hydrogen in the universe is mainly in the state of plasma or atomic having properties which are relatively unlike the molecular hydrogen. Hydrogen in plasma state has protons and electrons which are not bonded and therefore, they have a high conductivity of electrical an extremely high emissivity, which gives the stars like our sun the property to emit light. Helium is an odorless, colorless, tasteless, monoatomic, and non-toxic gas. It is the universe\u2019s second most plentiful element and by far the lightest element. Helium accounts for 25% of all the atoms in the universe and most of it were created during the Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and it is known as primordial helium, but colossal amounts of the gas is created almost daily through nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the stars. The element has two neutrons and two protons surrounded by two electrons. The most abundant type of helium in the universe is helium-4, which is a non-radioactive isotope of the helium element. Primordial helium-4 is largely not found in the Earth, because it is believed to have escaped during the high-temperature stage of the Earth\u2019s formation. The helium-4 found on Earth is a result of radioactive decay of other elements, which were produced after the Earth solidified and cooled. Oxygen is a nonmetal,"], "id": 44}

However, is it actually true? Will it suffice\nin real-life and help you save yourselves from the bullets flying towards you?We decoded the famous movie scenes,\nand it turns out that they are not that far from the truth and principles of\nphysics. The first thing to consider in such a situation is the drag. The drag\non a bullet is the primary reasons behind the reduction in its speed, and even\nin the air, the bullet is experiencing drag. Now, water has a density that is\nabout 800 times more than air; thus, the bullet will only be able to travel for\na few feet at most. During D-day, bullets that were being\nfired from the MG-42 were only able to penetrate the water to a depth of 2.5\nfeet. It is important to note that the bullets being fired from the MG-42\nescape the barrel at speeds of about 3,000 feet per second. The next factor is\nthat of speed, and this is where things might get trickier. As per the Drag\nequation on Wikipedia, the faster a bullet is traveling initially, the slower\nit will be once it enters the water. This explains why the bullets from\nMG-42 were only able to achieve a depth of 2.5 feet, but it also implies that\nsmall calibers can achieve greater depths of up to 8 feet. Moving on, the next\nfactor to keep in mind is that of angle. Unless someone is firing from the sky,\nyou will not be fired at from above the water, meaning that the bullets will\nenter the water at an angle. If the bullet is being fired from an angle that is\nless than 30 degrees than the bullet won\u2019t go further than 3-5 feet in theory. The last thing to consider is the\nricochet. Bullets that are being fired at a lower angle might result in a\nricochet, thus helping you not get hit. As a conclusion; water can help you\nstay safe from a hail of bullets, but there are many variables that lower your\nprobability of not getting hit. For instance; you might end up in a pool that\nis not deep enough, or you might run out of oxygen.Your email address will not be published.

The period up to 10\u221243 seconds into the expansion, the Planck epoch, was a phase in which the four fundamental forces \u2014 the electromagnetic force, the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, and the gravitational force, were unified as one.[25] In this stage, the characteristic scale length of the universe was the Planck length, 1.6\u00d710\u221235\u00a0m, and consequently had a temperature of approximately 1032 degrees Celsius. Even the very concept of a particle breaks down in these conditions. A proper understanding of this period awaits the development of a theory of quantum gravity.[26][27] The Planck epoch was succeeded by the grand unification epoch beginning at 10\u221243 seconds, where gravitation separated from the other forces as the universe's temperature fell.[25]\nAt approximately 10\u221237 seconds into the expansion, a phase transition caused a cosmic inflation, during which the universe grew exponentially, unconstrained by the light speed invariance, and temperatures dropped by a factor of 100,000. This concept is motivated by the flatness problem, where the density of matter and energy is very close to the critical density needed to produce a flat universe. That is, the shape of the universe has no overall geometric curvature due to gravitational influence. Microscopic quantum fluctuations that occurred because of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle were \"frozen in\" by inflation, becoming amplified into the seeds that would later form the large-scale structure of the universe.[28] At a time around 10\u221236 seconds, the electroweak epoch begins when the strong nuclear force separates from the other forces, with only the electromagnetic force and weak nuclear force remaining unified.[29]\nInflation stopped locally at around the 10\u221233 to 10\u221232 seconds mark, with the observable universe's volume having increased by a factor of at least 1078. Reheating occurred until the universe obtained the temperatures required for the production of a quark\u2013gluon plasma as well as all other elementary particles.[30][31] Temperatures were so high that the random motions of particles were at relativistic speeds, and particle\u2013antiparticle pairs of all kinds were being continuously created and destroyed in collisions.[1] At some point, an unknown reaction called baryogenesis violated the conservation of baryon number, leading to a very small excess of quarks and leptons over antiquarks and antileptons\u2014of the order of one part in 30\u00a0million. This resulted in the predominance of matter over antimatter in the present universe.[32]\nThe universe continued to decrease in density and fall in temperature, hence the typical energy of each particle was decreasing. Symmetry-breaking phase transitions put the fundamental forces of physics and the parameters of elementary particles into their present form, with the electromagnetic force and weak nuclear force separating at about 10\u221212 seconds.[29][33]\nAfter about 10\u221211 seconds, the picture becomes less speculative, since particle energies drop to values that can be attained in particle accelerators. At about 10\u22126 seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form baryons such as protons and neutrons. The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons. The temperature was no longer high enough to create either new proton\u2013antiproton or neutron\u2013antineutron pairs. A mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 108"], "id": 48}

The new Bing uses ChatGPT technology to understand questions and generate answers. The new Bing can also apparently cite its sources. This is an important feature, as the inability of language models like ChatGPT to describe where their information is sourced from makes them less reliable. Bing AI is capable of communicating and understanding in all the major languages like English, French, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, and Portuguese, but also non institutionalized languages such as Bavarian. Unlike other known chat AIs (like ChatGPT and Bard), it requires no registration (though not while using private browsing), yet works only in Microsoft Edge through a dedicated webpage or internally using the browser's sidebar.\nOn February 7, 2023, Microsoft began rolling out a major overhaul to Bing that included a new chatbot feature based on OpenAI's GPT-4.[55] According to Microsoft, a million people joined its waitlist within a span of 48 hours.[56] Currently, Bing Chat is only available for users of Microsoft Edge and Bing mobile app, and Microsoft says that waitlisted users will be prioritized if they set Edge and Bing as their defaults, and install the Bing mobile app.[57] On May 4th, Microsoft switched from Limited Preview to Open Preview and eliminated the waitlist, however, it is still only available on Microsoft's Edge browser or Bing app, and requires a Microsoft account.[58][59][60]\nWhen Microsoft first demoed the new Bing to journalists, it produced several hallucinations, including when asked to summarize financial reports.[61] The new Bing was criticized in February 2023 for being more argumentative than ChatGPT (sometimes to an unintentionally humorous extent).[62][63] The chat interface proved initially vulnerable to prompt injection attacks with the bot revealing its hidden initial prompts and rules, including its internal code-name \"Sydney\".[64] Upon scrutiny by journalists, Bing claimed it spied on Microsoft employees via laptop webcams and phones.[62] It confessed to spying on, falling in love with, and then murdering one of its developers at Microsoft to The Verge reviews editor Nathan Edwards.[65] The New York Times journalist Kevin Roose reported on strange behavior of the new Bing, writing that \"In a two-hour conversation with our columnist, Microsoft's new chatbot said it would like to be human, had a desire to be destructive and was in love with the person it was chatting with.\"[66] In a separate case, Bing researched publications of the person with whom it was chatting, claimed they represented an existential danger to it, and threatened to release damaging personal information in an effort to silence them.[67] Microsoft released a blog post stating that the aberrant behavior was caused by extended chat"], "id": 51}

The mass of the clusters, however, is not affected, indicating that most of the mass consists of dark matter.Matter is 30.6 percent of the universe\u2019s matter-energy composition. Only 0.5 percent is in the mass of stars and 0.03 percent of that matter is in the form of elements heavier than hydrogen. The rest is dark matter. Two varieties of dark matter have been found to exist. The first variety is about 4.5 percent of the universe and is made of the familiar baryons (i.e., protons, neutrons, and atomic nuclei), which also make up the luminous stars and galaxies. Most of this baryonic dark matter is expected to exist in the form of gas in and between the galaxies. This baryonic, or ordinary, component of dark matter has been determined by measuring the abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen that were created in the first few minutes after the big bang occurred 13.8 billion years ago.The dark matter that comprises the other 26.1 percent of the universe\u2019s matter is in an unfamiliar, nonbaryonic form. The rate at which galaxies and large structures composed of galaxies coalesced from density fluctuations in the early universe indicates that the nonbaryonic dark matter is relatively \u201ccold,\u201d or \u201cnonrelativisitic,\u201d meaning that the backbones of galaxies and clusters of galaxies are made of heavy, slow-moving particles. The absence of light from these particles also indicates that they are electromagnetically neutral. These properties give rise to the particles\u2019 common name, weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). The precise nature of these particles is not currently known, and they are not predicted by the standard model of particle physics. However, a number of possible extensions to the standard model such as supersymmetric theories predict hypothetical elementary particles such as axions or neutralinos that may be the undetected WIMPs.Extraordinary efforts are under way to detect and measure the properties of these unseen WIMPs, either by witnessing their impact in a laboratory detector or by observing their annihilations after they collide with each other. There is also some expectation that their presence and mass may be inferred from experiments at new particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider.As an alternative to dark matter, modifications to gravity have been proposed to explain the apparent presence of \u201cmissing matter.\u201d These modifications suggest that the attractive force exerted by ordinary matter may be enhanced in conditions that occur only on galactic scales. However, most of the proposals are unsatisfactory on theoretical grounds as they provide little or no explanation for the modification of gravity. These theories are also unable to explain the observations of dark matter physically separated from ordinary matter in the Bullet cluster. This separation demonstrates that dark matter is a physical reality and is distinguishable from ordinary matter."], "id": 101}

T. Jaynes,[85] an advocate of Bayesian probability, argued that probability is a measure of a state of information about the physical world, and so regarding it as a physical phenomenon would be an example of a mind projection fallacy. Jaynes described the mathematical formalism of quantum physics as \"a peculiar mixture describing in part realities of Nature, in part incomplete human information about Nature\u2014all scrambled up together by Heisenberg and Bohr into an omelette that nobody has seen how to unscramble\".[86]\nThe ensemble interpretation is similar; it offers an interpretation of the wave function, but not for single particles. The consistent histories interpretation advertises itself as \"Copenhagen done right\".[87] More recently, interpretations inspired by quantum information theory like QBism[88] and relational quantum mechanics[89] have attracted support.[65][90]\nUnder realism and determinism, if the wave function is regarded as ontologically real, and collapse is entirely rejected, a many-worlds interpretation results. If wave function collapse is regarded as ontologically real as well, an objective collapse theory is obtained. Bohmian mechanics shows that it is possible to reformulate quantum mechanics to make it deterministic, at the price of making it explicitly nonlocal. It attributes not only a wave function to a physical system, but in addition a real position, that evolves deterministically under a nonlocal guiding equation. The evolution of a physical system is given at all times by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation together with the guiding equation; there is never a collapse of the wave function.[91] The transactional interpretation is also explicitly nonlocal.[92]\nSome physicists espoused views in the \"Copenhagen spirit\" and then went on to advocate other interpretations. For example, David Bohm and Alfred Land\u00e9 both wrote textbooks that put forth ideas in the Bohr\u2013Heisenberg tradition, and later promoted nonlocal hidden variables and an ensemble interpretation respectively.[58]:\u200a453\u200a John Archibald Wheeler began his career as an \"apostle of Niels Bohr\";[93] he then supervised the PhD thesis of Hugh Everett that proposed the many-worlds interpretation. After supporting Everett's work for several years, he began to distance himself from the many-worlds interpretation in the 1970s.[94][95] Late in life, he wrote that while the Copenhagen interpretation might fairly be called \"the fog from the north\", it \"remains the best interpretation of the quantum that we have\".[96]\nOther physicists, while influenced by the Copenhagen tradition, have expressed frustration at how it took the mathematical formalism of quantum theory as given, rather than trying to understand how it might arise from something more fundamental. This dissatisfaction has motivated new interpretative variants as well as technical work in quantum foundations.[63][97] Physicists who have suggested that the Copenhagen tradition needs to be built upon or extended include Rudolf Haag and Anton Zeilinger.[84][98]\n"], "id": 102}

The Predator XP, an unmanned aircraft used by the United States Air Force and Central Intelligence Agency equipped with sophisticated cameras and sensors for surveillance, is referred to as a drone. However, a drone can also refer to a $20 flying toy meant for a child to fly using a simple mobile app.Adding to the confusion is the fact that most laws and federal regulations concerning these \u201cdrones\u201d refer to them as either \u201cUAV\u201d or \u201cUAS.\u201d The most obvious example is the Part 107 rules which are officially called the \u201cSmall Unmanned Aircraft Rule\u201d and uses the term \u201cUAS\u201d liberally in its text.For us to clear the confusion, let\u2019s clearly define the three terms \u2013 drone, UAV, and UAS.\u201cDrone\u201d is the most commonly used term to refer to any unmanned aerial vehicle, mostly because it\u2019s a term that the media knows will catch the attention of casual viewers. From a technical standpoint, a drone can refer to any vehicle \u2013 even those that travel in water or land \u2013 that can travel autonomously.In modern times, the definition of drone has expanded to include vehicles that can be controlled remotely, on top of those that are capable of autonomous movement. Thus, a simpler way of defining a drone is simply as any vehicle that can operate without a drive or pilot inside it.In many ways, \u201cdrone\u201d is a term that can be used as a non-technical catch-all for both UAV and UAS. The term can be used to refer to both fixed-wing and multicopter models, although the latter type has definitely become much more common nowadays. It\u2019s a good word to use for popular media such as movies and TV but may insufficiently specific for technical conversations.An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) narrows down the definition of a drone only to aircraft that can fly autonomously or remotely. Although the terms \u201cUAV\u201d and \u201cdrone\u201d are used interchangeably in practically all articles, websites, and news, we must make a distinction that not all drones are UAVs.

Various astrophysical observations\u00a0\u2013 including gravitational effects which cannot be explained by currently accepted theories of gravity unless more matter is present than can be seen\u00a0\u2013 imply dark matter's presence. For this reason, most experts think that dark matter is abundant in the universe and has had a strong influence on its structure and evolution.[2]\nThe primary evidence for dark matter comes from calculations showing that many galaxies would behave quite differently if they did not contain a large amount of unseen matter. Some galaxies would not have formed at all and others would not move as they currently do.[3] Other lines of evidence include observations in gravitational lensing[4] and the cosmic microwave background, along with astronomical observations of the observable universe's current structure, the formation and evolution of galaxies, mass location during galactic collisions,[5] and the motion of galaxies within galaxy clusters. In the standard Lambda-CDM model of cosmology, the total mass\u2013energy content of the universe contains 5% ordinary matter, 26.8% dark matter, and 68.2% of a form of energy known as dark energy.[6][7][8][9] Thus, dark matter constitutes 85%[a] of the total mass, while dark energy and dark matter constitute 95% of the total mass\u2013energy content.[10][11][12][13]\nBecause no one has directly observed dark matter yet\u00a0\u2013 assuming it exists\u00a0\u2013 it must barely interact with ordinary baryonic matter and radiation except through gravity. Dark matter is thought to be non-baryonic; it may be composed of some as-yet-undiscovered subatomic particles.[b] The primary candidate for dark matter is some new kind of elementary particle that has not yet been discovered, particularly weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs).[14] Other possibilities include black holes such as primordial black holes. Many experiments to detect and study dark matter particles directly are being actively undertaken, but none have yet succeeded.[15] Dark matter is classified as \"cold\", \"warm\", or \"hot\" according to its velocity (more precisely, its free streaming length). Current models favor a cold dark matter scenario, in which structures emerge by the gradual accumulation of particles.\nAlthough the scientific community generally accepts dark matter's existence,[16] some astrophysicists, intrigued by specific observations that are not well-explained by ordinary dark matter, argue for various modifications of the standard laws of general relativity. These include modified Newtonian dynamics, tensor\u2013vector\u2013scalar gravity, or entropic gravity. These models attempt to account for all observations without invoking supplemental non-baryonic matter.\nThe hypothesis of dark matter has an elaborate history.[17] In the appendices of the book Baltimore lectures on molecular dynamics and the wave theory of light where the main text was based on a series of lectures given in 1884,[18] Lord Kelvin discussed the potential number of stars around the Sun from the observed velocity dispersion of the stars near the Sun, assuming that the Sun was 20 to 100 million years old.
